I am a PhD candidate in Physics at Princeton University working on topics in theoretical biophysics. I am interested in using both analytical and data-oriented methods from statistical physics to understand collective behavior in biology, particularly in neuronal networks and animal behavior. 

In my PhD work, I closely collaborate with other members of the [Center for the Physics of Biological Function](https://biophysics.princeton.edu), in particular with my PhD advisor [William Bialek](http://www.princeton.edu/~wbialek/wbialek.html), and my experimental collabotrators in [Andy Leifer's group](http://leiferlab.princeton.edu).
