I am a postdoctoral researcher at LPENS, CNRS, working on topics in theoretical biophysics. I am interested in using both analytical and data-driven methods from statistical physics to understand collective behavior in biology, particularly in neuronal networks and animal behavior. Currently, I am working in the [Statistical Biophysics Group](https://sites.google.com/view/statbiophysens) led by Aleksandra Walczak and Thierry Mora. We are building statistical inference methods for collective dynamics in interacting systems. We are applying these models to understand how groups of mice run around when put together, working closely with the [Laboratory of Emotions Neurobiology](https://www.nencki.edu.pl/laboratories/laboratory-of-emotions-neurobiology/) lead by Ewelina Knapska in the Nencki Institute, Poland, and also how information flows in neuronal networks of zebrafish, working with [Claire Wyart's lab](https://wyartlab.org) in ICM Paris. 

Before my current position, I obtained my PhD degree in Physics from Princeton University in 2020. In my PhD work, I closely collaborated with other members of the [Center for the Physics of Biological Function](https://biophysics.princeton.edu), in particular with my PhD advisor [William Bialek](http://www.princeton.edu/~wbialek/wbialek.html). My work focused on the collective behavior in networks of neurons through both data-driven and more analytical approaches. In a project closely collaborating with [Andy Leifer's experimental lab](http://leiferlab.princeton.edu), we constructed models for the coherent neuronal activity in the nematode C.elegans. In a more theoretical project, we explored the possibility for interacting neuronal systems to achieve long time scales without fine tuning. 

In 2015, I obtained my Bachelor degree from Northwestern University in Integrated Science, Mathematics, and Physics. My undergraduate thesis work focused on fractal geometry in dissipative chaotic systems. I also had research experience in AMO physics, astrophysics, and archaeology.
