I am a postdoctoral researcher at LPENS, CNRS, working on topics in theoretical biophysics. Using both analytical and data-driven methods from statistical physics, I am devoted to understand the emergence of collective behavior in real biological networks, especially in neuronal networks and animal behavior. Currently, I am working in the [Statistical Biophysics Group](https://sites.google.com/view/statbiophysens) led by Aleksandra Walczak and Thierry Mora. We are building statistical inference methods for collective dynamics in interacting systems. We are applying these models to understand how groups of mice run around when put together, working closely with the [Laboratory of Emotions Neurobiology](https://www.nencki.edu.pl/laboratories/laboratory-of-emotions-neurobiology/) lead by Ewelina Knapska in the Nencki Institute, Poland, and also how information flows in neuronal networks of zebrafish, working with [Claire Wyart's lab](https://wyartlab.org) in ICM Paris. 

Before my current position, I obtained my PhD degree in Physics from Princeton University in 2020, supervised by William Bialek. My work focused on the collective behavior in networks of neurons through both data-driven and more analytical approaches, including constructing data-driven models for the coherent neuronal activity in the nematode C. elegans, and analytically exploring the possibility for interacting neuronal systems to achieve long time scales without fine tuning. I have also conducted research in dynamical systems and chaos, and atomic physics.
