I am a postdoctoral researcher at LPENS, CNRS, working on topics in theoretical biophysics. I am interested in using both analytical and data-driven methods from statistical physics to understand collective behavior in biology, particula rly in neuronal networks and animal behavior. Currently, I am working in the [Statistical Biophysics Group](https://sites.google.com/view/statbiophysens) led by Aleksandra Walczak and Thierry Mora.

Before my current position, I obtained my PhD degree in Physics from Princeton University. In my PhD work, I closely collaborated with other members of the [Center for the Physics of Biological Function](https://biophysics.princeton.edu), in particular with my PhD advisor [William Bialek](http://www.princeton.edu/~wbialek/wbialek.html), and my experimental collabotrators in [Andy Leifer's group](http://leiferlab.princeton.edu). I obtained my Bachelor degree from Northwestern University.
