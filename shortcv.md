#### Since 10/2020 -- Postdoctoral researcher, LPENS, CNRS

Working on modeling social behavior of animals in the [Statistical Biophysics Group](https://sites.google.com/view/statbiophysens) led by Aleksandra Walczak and Thierry Mora.

#### 09/2015 -- 09/2020 PhD in Physics, Princeton University

Obtained PhD with thesis title 'Statistical physics approaches to collective behavior in networks of neurons' , advised by [Bill Bialek](http://www.princeton.edu/~wbialek/wbialek.html). The thesis addressed collective behavior in neuronal networks through a combination of data analysis and analytical approaches. Part of the work was done in close collaboration with the experimental group of [Andy Leifer](http://leiferlab.princeton.edu) on C.elegans neuronal activity.

#### 09/2011 -- 06/2015 -- BA Integrated Science, Math, Physics, Northwestern University

Research experience through a bachelor thesis with [Adilson E. Motter](http://dyn.phys.northwestern.edu), two-year research experience with [Brian C. Odom](http://faculty.wcas.northwestern.edu/brian-odom/) on cold molecular ion experiment and simulation, a summer REU with [Fred Rasio](http://faculty.wcas.northwestern.edu/rasio/) and [Yoram Lithwick](http://faculty.wcas.northwestern.edu/yoram/) on binary star transfers, and a summer internship with [Matthew H. Johnson](https://www.anthropology.northwestern.edu/people/faculty/johnson.html) on archaeology.
